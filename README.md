# tldr.ee

Simple url-shortener powered by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Edit the `_redirects` file to add and remove redirects. It will deploy the updates as fast as possible :tm: and should not take longer than 5 min-ish at most for you to see the changes. If the path doesn't match any routes, it will fallback to https://exploratory.engineering
